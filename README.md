# AntCoin

A tiny BlockChain - my implementation in Kotlin

In [this article](https://dev.to/aunyks/lets-build-the-tiniest-blockchain), **Gerald Nash** showed a simple blockchain implementation.
He uses Pyton 2 and this implementation takes less than 50 lines of code, which he called **SnakeCoin**.

This is a trying to port Gerald's code to Kotlin.
